        Hello! I'm a Brazilian software developer who likes to create random stuff. <br /> <br />

        I created this website to serve as my "home base" on the internet, sometimes I post some interesting things here or just share my projects. <br /> <br />

        I don't post much on my blog, but sometimes it's nice to see old posts.
