This might be the sixth or seventh time I've tried to start a blog, but I always end up stopping posting.

Well, my previous blogs were based on workarounds written in Python to generate HTML from Markdown files, and this one is the same, but I'm using React for the entire website and some libraries; I'm not building everything from scratch.

I want to modernize my portfolio and personal website. I've decided to change the design and the stack I use, but I'm not a designer.

I'm still undecided whether to publish in English or Portuguese. I'll probably publish in English; it'll be good for practice, and it's also more universal.

Well, this first post was more of a test; I don't have much to comment on at the moment.

Testing:

# h1
## h2
### h3

- Item 1
- Item 2

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
